## Goal of the Game

The classic **Tic-Tac-Toe**:  
- Two players take turns marking `X` and `O` on a 3Ã—3 grid.
- The first to align three of their marks **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally** wins.
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## How It Was Built

This project was created using just **three files**:
- `index.html` for layout and structure.
- `style.css` for a **neon cyberpunk style**, inspired by Tokyo at night.  
  It uses a background image (`modern-tokyo.jpg`) and glowing UI effects.
- `script.js` for game logic, handling:
  - Turn-based play
  - Win condition checking
  - Draw detection
  - Game reset

Designed with **beginners in mind**: simple, readable, and easy to customize or expand.
